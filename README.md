# 🏋️‍♂️ Fitness Tracking & Recommendation Application

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **backend-focused fitness tracking application** developed using **Java and Spring Boot**, aimed at demonstrating hands-on implementation of REST APIs, authentication, database interaction, and security concepts commonly expected in **entry-level Java backend roles**.

The application provides APIs for **user registration, authentication, activity tracking, and fitness recommendations**, with secure access control and proper request validation. The project follows a guided tutorial and focuses on practical backend engineering fundamentals.

## 🏗️ Application Architecture
- **Controller Layer** – Handles HTTP requests and responses using REST endpoints  
- **Service Layer** – Contains business logic for user management, activities, and recommendations  
- **Repository Layer** – Manages database operations using Spring Data JPA  
- **Security Layer** – Implements JWT authentication, authorization filters, and RBAC  
- **DTO Layer** – Manages request and response payloads to maintain clean API contracts  

---

## 🔐 Security Implementation
- JWT-based authentication for stateless API security  
- Custom filters for token validation  
- Password encryption using BCrypt  
- Role-based access control for protected routes  
- Method-level security where applicable  

---

## 🧪 Validation & Documentation
- Request validation using Bean Validation annotations  
- Structured error handling for API responses  
- Swagger UI for API exploration and testing  

---
